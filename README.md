A native Android client for downloading media from the Internet using [cobalt server APIs](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/main/docs/api.md).

White Cobalt follows the principles of [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools/):

- `No ads, trackers, paywalls, or other nonsense.`
- `Was created for public benefit.`
- `Paste the link, get the file, move on. that simple, just how it should be.`

White Cobalt is a tool that makes downloading public content easier. It takes zero liability. The end user is responsible for what they download, how they use and distribute that content.

White Cobalt is in no way a piracy tool and cannot be used as such. It can only download free & publicly accessible content.

White Cobalt was developed independently of the [creators of cobalt.tools](https://github.com/imputnet).
